            <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence</h3>
            <p>
                Emotional Intelligence (EQ) is your awareness of your self and your emotions. It is also your ability to recognise the same things in others.
            </p>
            <p>
                With practice you can learn to realise how you are feeling and why. This applies to others as well. By paying attention to body language as well as what someone is saying.

                Now for one of my favourite SciFi quotes...
            </p>
            <p>
                “I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”
            </p>
            <p>
                ― Frank Herbert, Dune
            </p>
            <p>
                Herbert comes close to some of the ideas about practicing EQ. Once you can recognise an emotion you can face it and let it pass leaving your actions untouched. You may be afraid but that doesn't meant you have to act afraid.
            </p>
            <p>
                Practicing Emotional Intelligence helps us navigate our personal and professional lives.

            <h3>How does it differ from IQ</h3>                
            <p>
                IQ is an attempt to gauge how smart someone is. It is you ability to solve problems logically. EQ is about how to solve emotional problems. It is how good you are at relating to others and dealing with emotional problems within your self and between people.
            </p>    
            <h3>Why is EQ important</h3>                   
            <p>
                EQ is important as it lets a person attend to their own and others emotions. This ability plays a huge role in you every social interaction from the personal to professional. It is part of being a well rounded individual and quite simply key to not being a dick.
