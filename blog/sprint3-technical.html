        <h3>HTML vs CSS</h3>
        <p>HTML is the structure and content of a page. 
            If it were a book it would be the headings, paragraphs, images and footnotes. 
            With only HTML our book looks like a manuscript. 
            Just text on a page all in a single font and with no style what so ever.</p>
        <div class="image" >
            <img src="../pictures/Manuscript.jpg" alt="manuscript" height=250>
        </div>
        <p>CSS is a documents style. It takes our manuscript and fleshes it out.
            Turning something bland into a proper book.
            Pages get columns, headings are bold, fonts change.</p>

        <h3>Control Flow and Loops</h3>
        <p>Control flow is the order in which a computer reads and executes code. 
            This is normally top to bottom in the same way you would read a list of instructions.</p>

        <p>Example: calling somone from your mobile</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pick up phone</li>
            <li>Unlock phone</li>
            <li>Open call app</li>
            <li>Dial number</li>
            <li>Press call button</li> 
            <li>Wait for answer</li>
        </ul>

        <p>There are exceptions to the normal flow of a computer reading and executing code. Loops are a common exception. 
        In a loop the computer will keep repeating the requested steps until a specified condition is met.</p>

        <p>Example: Attempting to send a fax (why does faxing still exist) 5 times.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dial number</li>
            <li>Await pickup</li>
            <li>If answered transmit fax</li>
            <li>If less than 5 attempt try again</li>
            <li>Otherwise faxing fails</li> 
        </ul>

    
        <h3>The DOM and interacting with it</h3>
        
        <p>The Document Object Model (or DOM) is the glue that binds HTML's structure, CCS's style, and Javascript's interactivity together. 
            The DOM is shown as a tree view of the files that make up webpages page.
            The tree is made up of nodes and objects. The vast majority of these that we care about are elements.</p>
                
        <p>A powerful feature of the DOM is that it allows you to modify the document elements that make up a page it real time. 
            This allows you to tweak layout and style in real time to test changes or fix bugs.
             So far I have found this particularly helpful for CSS bugs.</p>

        <p>To interact with the DOM you can right click on any webpage in your browser and click inspect.
        The image below is an example of how the DOM is displayed for this webpage.</p>
            
        <div class="image">
            <img src="../pictures/DocumentObjectModel.png" alt="DOM" height=500>
        </div>

        <p>The DOM is editable in real time. The entire document that makes up a webpage can be edited.
            As an example you could edit border-color at the bottom of the image to replace 'black' with 'white' and the borders on the page would turn white.
            This allows developers to quickly test changes or play around with ideas.</p>
            
        <h3>Accessing data from Objects and Arrays</h3>
            
        <p>Arrays are a series of variables stored in order. 
            These variables are indexed starting with 0 for the first value. 
            Like houses on a street if the first house was 0.</p>

        <p>As arrays are ordered you can modify, add or remove values from the start, end or a specific position.</p>
                
        <p>Objects are information stored using 'keys'. 
            Eg. Object Car contains a number of components, each containing a numver of values (part number, number in the car, etc).
            When accessing this information you ask the program to return car -> wheels -> number and it will return '4'.</p>
                
        <h3>Functions and why they are useful</h3>
        
        <p>A function is a block of code that does a task. Functions are then strung together to make complex programs.</p>

        <p>This example function below tells you if a number (num) is 'bigger than 10' and if not (else) tells you it is 'less than 10'</p>
                
        <p>if (num > 10) {
            return "Bigger than 10";
            } else {
            return "10 or Less";
            }</p>

        <p>Functions are how you tell a computer to do stuff. 
            When you click '=' on a calculator it runs functions to determine the result. 
            When you turn you computer on functions run to load the operating system so you cna do things. 
            They are the building blocks of everything.</p>
