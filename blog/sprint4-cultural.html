            <h2>Neuroplasticity and the Growth Mindset</h2> 
        </div>

        <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
        <p>People with an understanding of neuroplasticity understand that their brain can change and with it their knowledge and skills. Just because you were bad at math doesn’t mean you can’t practice and become adept at it. If you understand that it is not innate talent but practice that makes perfect then you can focus on the practice and not your starting point.
        </p>
        
        <p>The main principle of neuroplasticity is that repeatedly using you brain improves it. If you want to get better at something you need to practice it and think about it (mental practice).</p>

        <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
        <p>The growth mindset is that if you work on something your ability for it will grow. This is relevant to any skill in life. Learning to tie your shoes is something most people struggled with when they were little. Because you had to do it every time you left the house within a year or two you could literally do it with your eyes closed. This same growth applies to every skill or topic you want to learn about.</p>

        * I’m integrating the growth mindset into my learning but trying to think about, learn about, and practice coding every day.
