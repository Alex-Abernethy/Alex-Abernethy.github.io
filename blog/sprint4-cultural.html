            <h2>Neuroplasticity and the Growth Mindset</h2> 
        </div>

        <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
        <p>People with an understanding of neuroplasticity understand that their brain can change and with it their knowledge and skills. 
            Just because you were bad at math doesn’t mean you can’t practice and become adept at it. 
            If you understand that it is not innate talent but practice that makes perfect then you can focus on the practice and not your starting point.
        </p>
        
        <p>The main principle of neuroplasticity is that repeatedly using you brain improves it. 
            If you want to get better at something you need to practice it and think about it (mental practice).</p>

        <p>Here are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Get enough sleep</li>
            <li>Keep learning new things</li>
            <li>Reduce stress</li>
            <li>Find purose or interest in the topic you are learning.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
        <p>The growth mindset is that if you work on something your ability for it will grow. 
            This is relevant to any skill in life. 
            Learning to tie your shoes is something most people struggled with when they were little. 
            Because you had to do it every time you left the house within a year or two you could literally do it with your eyes closed. 
            This same growth applies to every skill or topic you want to learn about.</p>

        <p>An important part of the Growth Mindset is knowing you can improve. 
            Even if you are stuggling with a skill or material you need to keep in mind that the struggle is practice.
            Thinking about what you did wrong and how to imporave on it is a form of practice.
            So even when you are beating yourself up you are potantially settign yourself up to be better next time.</p>

        <p>I’m integrating the growth mindset into my learning but trying to think about, learn about, and practice coding every day.</p>
