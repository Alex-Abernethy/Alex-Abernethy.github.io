        <h3>Getting Blocked and Problem Solving</h3>
        
        <p>
          A problem I got stuck on was writing code to remove any instance of 'buzz' from a string. Using pseudocode to plan I got initial code working quickly. I got stuck on how to do it in a case insensitive manner. I knew I could write code to remove 'buzz, Buzz, BUzz, BuZz, etc.' but that would be messy and there is a chance I would miss something.
        </p>

        <p>
          To solve this I looked up various options and setteled on RegEx (regular expression). This had the bonus that I've seen them before and had no clue how they really worked. So I got to solve a problem and satiate my curiousity at the same time.
        </p>

        <p>
          <pre>
            <code>
              function deBee(str) {
                var words = str.split(' ');
            
                var deBeeStr = words.filter(function(val) {
                  return !/buzz/i.test(val);
                });
                return deBeeStr.join(' ');
              }
            </code>
          </pre>
        </p>

        <p>
          This function splits up the string into individual words, filters out 'buzz' in a case insensitive manner by testing for 'buzz' in any case. It then joins the words back together as a new string.
        </p>

        <p>
          During this process I managed to turn my frustration into curisousity and learn something new. Before working out my way forward I wasted sometime trying to find ways to do this elegantly.
        </p>

        <h3>Solving Something Elegantly</h3>

        <p>
          I refactored my code for concatenating strings together to make it simpler.
        </p>

        <p>
          Version I
          <pre>
            <code>
              function concatMyArray (arr){
                arrayString = arr.join('');
                return arrayString;
              }
            </code>
          </pre>
        </p>

        <p>
          Version II
          <pre>
            <code>
              function concatMyArray (arr){
                return arrayString = arr.join('');
              }
            </code>
          </pre>
        </p>

        <p>
          Version III
          <pre>
            <code>
              function concatMyArray (arr){
                return arr.join('');
              }
            </code>
          </pre>
        </p>

        <p>
          This situation didn't require much in the way of problem solving. However I went back and rewrote it as a simple way of implementing things I had learnt during the other JS coding katas. First to set the variable and return it in a single line and then to remove the variable altogether after realising it was never required.

        <h3>Reflections on Problem Solving Techniques</h3>
        <p>
          This comic sums up how I feel when trying the rubber ducky method.

        <p>
          That said I've started using pseudocode and while doing that I reason out the steps to myself in much the same way just without the ducky to talk to. I can already see real value to using pseudocode to work through problems.
        </p>

        <p>
          My next steps are to google how to do the steps in my code then try things. My favourite tools for this so far are <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">W3Schools</a> and these <a href="https://htmlcheatsheet.com">cheatsheets</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Once this inevitably doesn't work on the first try I start trying to Console log what my code is doing vs what I expect it to do. This either shows up some problem with the code or my logic. If the code's not working as expected I google it. If there's a problem with my logic/steps then I try something again with changes. The error meesages in the most recent sprint helped with this process and learning test driven development going forward is something I will need to practice.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have already notice myself improving with reflection. Problems are easier the next day after thinking about them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Asking peers and mentors for help is something I have needed to do much of yet. It's something I find difficult to do at the moment while working remotely. It will be easier for me once boot camp starts and I get to know people better.
