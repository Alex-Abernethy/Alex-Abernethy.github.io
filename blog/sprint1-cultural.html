       <p>1. Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.
            * Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. 
            Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, 
            the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</p>
        
        <p>I value honesty. A kid at kindy asked my son for a present for Xmas. 
        They are close friends and we had already discussed getting him something. 
        Somehow this conversation lead to them saying “get me a gift or I’ll hit you” 
        and my son later telling me "I want to get him something or he will hit me”. 
        I have no idea to this day how this came about.</p>
        
        <p>I was left with the options of let it go, tell the teachers, or tell their mum. 
        I felt like the honest straight forward approach was tell their mum and then tell 
        the teachers in case it comes up or similar behaviour occurs. I felt this had the 
        least ways to backfire and the best chance of positive outcomes. 
        The downside was a potentially very awkward conversation/confrontation I would prefer to avoid.</p>
        
        <p>When I went to have this awkward conversation it became quickly apparent that she already knew. 
        Her kid had confessed that night and had already been talked to about how we do not threaten our friends. 
        Everything worked out well and they remain good friends.</p>
        
        
        <p>* Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</p>
        
        <p>I’m from an individualist culture and value action by individuals. 
            I’m beginning to see a more collectivist view of actions and values as being a key part of society.</p>
        
        <p>My father has instilled a interest in learning and knowledge. 
            He’s was exceptional at getting me interested in reading and buying me any books I wanted. 
            Even at his busiest he tried to make time to read bed time stories late into my primary school years when I took over reading to myself in the evenings. 
            Having the hobbit read to me at approx 5 year old was one of my favourites.</p>
        
        <p>Both sides of my family are organised effectively by a matriarchy. 
            My mum, aunts, and nana’s have always organised my family. 
            These strong nurturing role models influence how I am as a parent and my roles around the house. 
            I work part time currently to help care for our children. 
            I see it not as a sacrifice of career but something I am lucky to be able to do.</p>

        <p>1. Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</p>

        <p>* Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. 
            Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</p>
        
        <p>I have a tendency to act first and think things through later. This can be both a strength and a weakness.
        I’m individualistic and tend to see problems as something solved by individual agency. 
        It's difficult for me to step back and not act or tell people what to do to fix something. 
        Sometimes someone just needs to talk about their problem and not have it solved for them.</p>
        
        <p>* Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</p>
        
        <p>I’m good a learning of the sake of knowledge. 
            If something is interesting to me I am happy learning about it for my own interest. 
            I work in a medical laboratory in IT support. 
            I find it interesting talking to the scientists and pathologists about their fields. 
            Because of this I have learnt a great deal about how the laboratory runs. 
            This knowledge is far above and beyond what is required for my role.</p>
        
        <p>I struggle to motivate myself to learn other information though. 
            I struggled with English and how to write essays. 
            I’m also terrible at rote learning things like dates of historical events (eg. the start and end of WWI).</p>
        
        <p>I haven’t developed my career enough as I have always had other priorities and lacked the specific training to advance. 
        I hope to fix this by attending EDA. Code and how tech works has always fascinated me and I hope that it will encourage me to continuously learn.</p>
        
        <p>* Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</p>
        
        <p>I value knowledge and have a personal interest in tech and how things work. 
            I hope that this will drive my learning forward.</p>
        
        <p>Forming a habit of making time for the course and not going down the rabbit hole of a particular problem or idea will be the struggle for me. 
            I’ll need to keep the idea of just in time learning in mind.</p>
        
        <p>* Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, 
            but there was resistance or tension. 
            Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, 
            and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</p>
        
        <p>On a university field trip for biology we were assigned teams and had to do a 2-3 day research assignment. 
            We studied the differences in a species of plants relating to altitude. 
            One member fo the team was particularly hard to deal with and wanted to do things their way for everything.</p>
        
        <p>My approach to this was to give him tasks that interested him most and more leeway in how they were done as a form of appeasement. 
            It was easier for the rest of us to get on with our tasks unimpeded. 
            The end result was the two of us almost coming to blows the evening before our presentation.</p>
        
        <p>In hind sight while my actions helped get work done they didn’t resolve the underlying personality clashes allowing it to eventually come to a head. 
            In similar situations since then I have put more effort into getting along with people I have conflicts with.</p>
