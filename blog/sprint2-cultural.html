                <p>My main goal at EDA is learning the skills to make things. I’m happiest putting things together or pulling them apart to see how they work. I’m more interesting in the backend workings of websites. While at EDA I also want to develop my collaboration skills when working as a team.</p>   
                <p>I have a desire to learn for the sake of knowledge. This helps me dive into topics of interest. I need to put effort into building habits for the subjects that aren’t immediately appealing. These habits will also help me stay on top of my workload.</p>
                <p>I’m building a habit of working on course material everyday. I enjoy teaching so I’m trying to put time aside to help others as well. This will aid teamwork and help me better reflect on and remember information.</p>    
                <p>When stuck or frustrated I will stop, relax, and take a break. If my second attempt makes no progress and ends in frustration I will reach out to others for help or guidance. I want to strike a balance of trying to stretch my abilities without fruitlessly banging up against a wall.</p>    
                <p>I expect the facilitation team to guide my learning. I want them to point me at the things I need ‘just in time’ so I don’t go down the rabbit hole on a particular topic. I also expect them to show me things to stretch for when required.</p>    
                <p>I’m a parent of two children so something will inevitably come up. I promise to provide as much warning as possible to anyone I am working with if I am unable to meet a commitment.</p>
