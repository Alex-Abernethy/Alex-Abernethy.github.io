            <h2>Core Learning Reflections</h2> 
        </div>

        <p>
          * What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
        </p>
        <p>
          I found that I baulked at explaining my emotions or decisions in text in a public space. This somewhat surprised me as I would normally happily describe my position on any topic face to face with someone. I also found that I’m much more careful explaining myself in text than in person where I have to option to immediately say ‘oops that came out wrong’.
        </p>
        <p>  
          I also found it an interesting (if somewhat frustrating) exercise trying to work through my values and put them into words. It’s a different thing describing where you stand compared to just thinking here I am.
        </p>
        <p>
          * What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
        </p>
        <p>
            I was surprised by the ideas behind it. I studied psychology at university and seeing some those ideas put to use to train students was interesting. I’ve never had teachers explain the reasoning behind teaching choices before.
        </p>
        <p>
          * What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
        </p>
        <p>
          Putting my thoughts into words in a way that is concise for others to read was something I found difficult. There are a great many ways to come across like a pompous jerk when trying to make a point using text where no-one can see your body language or tone.
        </p>
        <p>
          * Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
        </p>
        <p>
          Getting along with others and communicating are such a large part of any workplace. The more nuanced or complicated a discussion the more important communication becomes. Good soft skill avoid people waste time arguing pointlessly over minutiae due to a misunderstanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          * Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Studying core skills often feels like a waste when you want to be doing something else. It is still something useful to have done. People reflecting on their choices/actions is how they grow.
